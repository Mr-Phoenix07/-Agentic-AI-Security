# Controlled Tool Integration Layer

> Deliverables addressed: **tool adapter architecture** (§4/§35.5), **tool
> registry format** (§35.12), **intelligent test selection** (§11), **tool
> sandbox / controlled execution** (§21), **AI safety controls** (§34).

AEGIS's agents orchestrate *external* security tooling — Nmap, Nuclei, httpx,
ffuf, Semgrep, Trivy, and so on. The danger with "AI + Kali tools" glue is that
a language model ends up choosing and running commands directly. AEGIS is built
the other way around: **every external tool passes through one controlled,
auditable choke point**, and the model never authors a command line.

Package: [`aegis/tools/`](../aegis/tools/)

## The adapter contract (`ToolSpec`)

Every tool is described by a `ToolSpec` before AEGIS will touch it (spec §4):

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `name` / `binary` | logical name and the allow-listed executable |
| `category` | capability bucket (`recon`, `web_scan`, `network`, `static_analysis`, …) |
| `purpose` | one-line description |
| `risk_level` | `PASSIVE < SAFE < ACTIVE < INTRUSIVE < DANGEROUS` |
| `supported_targets` | which `TargetKind`s it applies to |
| `applies_when` | observed signals that make it applicable (`http`, `graphql`, `domain`, …) |
| `requires_network` | blocked in offline mode against non-local targets |
| `evidence_format` | `text` / `json` / `jsonl` / `xml` |
| `input_schema` | structured, documented parameters |
| `command_builder` | **structured params → argv `list[str]`** (no shell string) |
| `parser` | raw output → structured `ParsedObservation`s |

A tool is invoked with a **`ToolInvocation`** (`tool`, `target`, structured
`params`, attribution, reason) — never a free-form command. The `command_builder`
turns validated params into an argv token list; `build_argv_safe()` rejects a
pre-joined string so shell semantics can't sneak back in.

### Executable vs. documentation-only

`command_builder is None` marks a **documentation-only contract**: AEGIS knows
the tool exists and how it fits the plan, but **will refuse to auto-run it**.
This is how exploitation / credential / DoS class tools (`sqlmap`, `metasploit`,
`hydra`) are represented — present for *planning* ("an IDOR here could be
validated with X"), but requiring a human to implement and authorize a scoped
adapter. No offensive payloads live in the catalog.

## Intelligent test selection (`ToolRegistry.select`)

Given an observed `TargetProfile` (kind + signals) the registry returns a
`SelectionPlan` — the applicable tools **with a reason for each**, plus the
tools it *excluded* and why. Nothing is executed; this is planning.

```bash
aegis tools list
aegis tools select --kind web_app --signals http,https,web,domain,graphql,jwt
```

Example (a React + Node + GraphQL + JWT web target): `subfinder`, `httpx`,
`whatweb`, `nuclei`, `ffuf`, `gobuster` are selected as runnable; `sqlmap` /
`hydra` surface as **advisory** (documentation-only, not enabled).

## The controlled executor (`ToolExecutor`)

Nothing in AEGIS calls `subprocess` directly — it goes through the executor,
which enforces, in strict order, and records **an immutable audit record for
every attempt (allowed, refused, or errored)**:

1. **Known & executable** — registered tool with a `command_builder`; binary on
   the allow-list. Documentation-only tools are refused here.
2. **Scope validation (fail-closed)** — the target is routed through the
   engagement's `AuthorizationScope`. Out of scope ⇒ refused; **nothing spawns**.
3. **Offline policy** — network tools are refused against non-local targets when
   `offline=True`.
4. **Engagement class switches** — `DANGEROUS` tools require `exploitation=True`;
   credential tools require `credential_testing=True`; both default off.
5. **No shell** — argv is a validated `list[str]` run with `shell=False` and a
   minimal env. There is no interpolation and no model-authored command line.
6. **Approval gate** — anything at or above `ACTIVE` risk requires a human
   approval callback to return `True` (default: deny — fail-closed).
7. **Dry-run by default** — the executor resolves and validates everything and
   returns the argv it *would* run, executing nothing, unless a caller explicitly
   opts into real execution.
8. **Bounded execution** — wall-clock timeout, captured stdout/stderr, exit code.

```python
from aegis.tools import ToolRegistry, ToolExecutor, ToolInvocation
from aegis.core.authorization import AuthorizationScope, ScopeRule

scope = AuthorizationScope([ScopeRule(
    label="engagement-42", hosts=["*.authorized.example"],
    url_globs=["https://authorized.example/*"], authorization_ref="SoW-42")])

reg = ToolRegistry()
ex = ToolExecutor(scope, dry_run=True,                 # preview only
                  approval=lambda inv, spec, dec: True) # human-in-the-loop

res = ex.run(ToolInvocation(tool="nuclei",
                            target="https://authorized.example",
                            reason="signature scan of authorized surface"),
             reg.get("nuclei"))
# res.argv -> the exact command; res.dry_run == True; nothing executed.
# ex.audit_log[-1] -> the ToolRunRecord (scope decision, approval, outcome).
```

Even in real-execution mode with all approvals granted, an out-of-scope target
is refused **before any process is spawned**.

## Audit trail

Each `ToolRunRecord` is emitted on the message bus (`tool.run`) and can be
persisted append-only to the `tool_runs` table
([`aegis/storage/schema.sql`](../aegis/storage/schema.sql)) via
`Database.save_tool_run(...)`. The record captures the command, target, scope
decision, approval, risk level, dry-run flag, exit code, and outcome — satisfying
the "record every tool call" requirement of the AI safety controls (§34) and the
trust hierarchy *raw output → parsed observation → analysis → validated finding*.

## Adding a tool

Implement a `command_builder` (structured params → argv) and, optionally, a
`parser`, then register a `ToolSpec`. The orchestrator picks it up automatically
via `applies_when` / `supported_targets` — the executor's guarantees apply with
no further wiring. For an intrusive tool, ship it **documentation-only** (no
builder) until a human implements and authorizes the adapter for the engagement.
