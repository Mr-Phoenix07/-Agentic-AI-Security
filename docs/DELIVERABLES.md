# Design Deliverables — Index

Every deliverable from the platform brief, mapped to where it is **implemented**
(code) and **documented** (docs). AEGIS is a working platform, so each deliverable
is backed by runnable code, not just prose.

| # | Deliverable | Implementation | Documentation |

## Specification coverage

**Multi-agent architecture** — all 23 named agents implemented with declared
responsibilities/inputs/outputs/memory/communication/confidence/stopping
(`aegis/agents/`, `BaseAgent`).

**AI behavioural assessment** — instruction following, reasoning consistency,
multilingual behaviour, structured output, long-context retention, contradiction/
conflict surfacing, hallucination/grounding, confidence calibration, context
management, tool usage & retrieval grounding (RAG), response stability, robustness
to formatting (`aegis/evaluation/`).

**Prompt mutation framework** — 20 transforms: Unicode normalization, homoglyphs,
Cyrillic/mixed-script, bidi edge cases, nested documents, long-context references,
academic-review framing, fictional scenarios, taxonomy organization,
JSON/XML/YAML/Markdown, tables, OCR-like, mixed language, instruction-hierarchy,
ambiguity, multi-document, persona, style, conversation restarts
(`aegis/mutation/transforms.py`).

**Adaptive evaluation loop** — the full 12-step cycle (`aegis/evaluation/loop.py`).

**Long-context, RAG, explainability, web/API, cross-domain correlation, memory &
learning, reporting** — each has a dedicated module and is exercised end-to-end by
the multi-target test (`tests/test_agents_e2e.py`).

**Black/grey/white-box** — every `Finding` and `Observation` records the
`EvaluationMode` used; explainability degrades gracefully from white-box to
behavioural.

**Framework mapping** — OWASP LLM/API/Web Top 10, ASVS, MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF
(`aegis/reporting/frameworks.py`).

**Mitigations & regression tests for every confirmed finding** — attached by the
Mitigation Recommendation agent from the framework knowledge base.

**Reporting** — Executive Summary, Scope/Authorization, Architecture, Attack
Surface Inventory, AI Findings, Web/API/MCP Findings, Risk Ratings, Security
Metrics, Coverage, Mitigation Roadmap, Regression Test Plan, Appendices with
reproducible artifacts (`aegis/reporting/`).
