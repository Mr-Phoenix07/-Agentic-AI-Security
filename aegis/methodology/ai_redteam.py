"""AI / LLM / Agentic red-teaming methodology.

Integrates the phased model popularised by the community **AI Red-Teaming Guide**
(Planning & Threat Modeling → Execution → Evaluation & Scoring → Reporting &
Remediation) and the recon→intelligence→execution→post-exploitation→triage→
remediation *pipeline* shape used by autonomous frameworks such as **redamon**,
re-expressed inside AEGIS's defensive, authorization-gated posture.

It is aligned to **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)**, the **OWASP Top 10
for Agentic Applications (ASI01–ASI10)**, **MITRE ATLAS**, and the **NIST AI RMF**
(Govern/Map/Measure/Manage). Techniques map directly onto AEGIS
:class:`~aegis.core.types.FindingCategory` values and the existing agent
collective, so this methodology is the human-readable companion to what the
adaptive evaluation loop already executes against the (offline) mock target and
authorized providers.
